# Problem: Longest Subarray with Equal Number of 0s and 1s

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description

Given a binary array `nums`, return the **length of the longest contiguous subarray** with an equal number of `0`s and `1`s.

### Example 1:
```bash
Input: nums = [0,1] Output: 2 Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest subarray with equal number of 0s and 1s.
```

### Example 2:
```bash
Input: nums = [0,1,0] Output: 2 Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is the longest subarray with equal number of 0s and 1s.
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
